## Estimate of hours
Around 7 days were spent on this project.
## How I tested my code
Initially, we tested our code manually. Once we completed the baseline features, we wrote a single file for testing and continuously added relevant test cases to ensure the features worked correctly. Additionally, we created a simple file to activate Github Actions and confirm that the tests worked well.
## Bugs and Issues

## An example of difficult issue how I resolved

## Extensions
### Relational Operations
####
    x = 100
    y = 5
    print x == y, x <= 100, y >= 4 
    print x != y, x != 100          
    print x > 101, y < 4
    0 1 1
    1 0
    0 0
####
### Boolean Operations
Since we implement op-equals extension, we include **op=** in Boolean Operations as well.
####
    x = 1
    y = 2
    print x && y, x || 0, y != 1, !x
    print x != 0, x ||= 0, y &&= 1
    1 1 1 0
    1 1 1
